## 📋 About TRIP

TRIP Dashboard is a comprehensive fleet management system designed for bus operators in Cebu, Philippines. It provides a unified platform for managing bus operations, tracking revenue, and monitoring fleet performance through encrypted, tamper-proof data collection.

**Mission**: Modernize public transportation management by providing bus companies with a digital, data-driven platform that enhances operational efficiency, prevents fare evasion, and delivers actionable insights through comprehensive analytics.

## 🚌 The Transit Node (Product 1)

Transform every bus into a smart terminal. The Transit Node is deployed on each bus, creating a seamless digital experience for passengers and conductors.

### Features

- **QR Code Payments**: Instant cashless payments via QR codes. Passengers scan, pay, and board in seconds.
- **One-Tap Stop Requests**: Passengers request stops with a single tap. No more shouting or missed stops.
- **Conductor Interface**: Simple interface for conductors to upload trip data. Secure, encrypted submission after each trip.

### Passenger Experience

Board the bus, scan the QR code at your seat, pay with your preferred method, and request your stop—all from your phone or the in-bus terminal.

- 💳 Multiple Payment Options (Cash, QR codes, digital wallets)
- 🎯 Never Miss a Stop

## 🏢 The Fleet Command (Product 2)

Your operational command center. Analyze performance and make informed decisions with comprehensive trip data collected after each journey.

### Features

- **Data Encryption & Security**: End-to-end encryption prevents data tampering. Conductors and passengers cannot modify trip data, eliminating fare evasion.
- **Post-Trip Analytics**: Trip data syncs to the dashboard after each journey. Analyze revenue per route, per bus, and identify trends.
- **Revenue Tracking**: Comprehensive financial reports updated after each trip. Track earnings, payment methods, and passenger categories.
